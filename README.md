# lousybench
Simple multi-thread cross-platform (ok, java-crossplatform) benchmark  
Very stupid and very lousy  
Avaliable keys:  
--help or -h -- this help, srsly  
--size or -s -- matrix sizes  
--threads or -t -- threads count. All threads independent and calculate it's own matrix  
This benchmark:  
* Calculate integer matrix (with size -s) 
* Same with real matrix 
* Same with math equals (cos, sin, tan, exp etc) 
* Mark start and stop calculation 
* Print average time in nanos
